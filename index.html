            Hello, my name is Waleed Ehab McLean. I am currently a full-stack
            developer student in the UNC Coding Bootcamp. I began coding in
            August of 2020, learning different styles and languages. I chose to
            learn how to code for a myriad of reasons, mainly to change careers,
            learn new skills that will help me later on in life, and also to
            potentially teach others how to code.
          </p></div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>
            I was born in Lumberton, North Carolina on February 24, 1986, and
            grew up in Saint Pauls, North Carolina. In 2004, I graduated from
            Saint Pauls High School in Saint Pauls, North Carolina, enrolling at
            Winston-Salem State University shortly after. Unfortunately I had to
            withdraw from the university in 2006 for personal issues. In 2007, I
            began working for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company until I
            resigned in 2020 to take the UNC Bootcamp.

            Although I withdrew from WSSU, I re-enrolled to the school in 2018,
            switching my concentration from History to Finance and Computer
            Science. I continued going to the school until this past year when I
            decided to not go to school for the Fall 2019/Spring 2020 semester.
            The reason for this was because of financial issues (I was paying
            for all school expenses myself) and the COVID-19 pandemic.
